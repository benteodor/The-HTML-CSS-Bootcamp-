 ## Description 
This incredible LinkedIn course taught me the principles of HTML and CSS again, giving me the opportunity to practice all of the theory I had already learned, but at a more advanced level. I learnt about animated buttons, flexbox, grid, CSS variables, gradient borders, media queries, and pseudo elements, among other things, and I practiced a lot to improve my HTML and CSS skills.
